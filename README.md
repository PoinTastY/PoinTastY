My name is Kevin Becerra, im a Jr. Software Engineer.

I love coding in python and C#, so naturally im focused on .Net technologies, ive made a few MAUI applications and RESTFUL API's to provide solutions as a freelancer

anyway, some of the things that i have experience with:

- .Net MAUI
- ASP .Net Core
- Minimmal/Controlled based API's
- Entity Framework
- Dependency Injection
- Scripting (mostly with python)
- SQL
- Database Management (mostly Postgres, but I can handle any motor)
- Clean Architecture
- Selenium
- NUNIT
- C#
- Python
- C++
- C
- Web Development (HTML, CSS, JavaScript)
- Shell (CLI usage in general)

As a freelancer i have developed a few projects, but as you can understand the most important ones need to remain private, but here is one that i can share, from the organization of Stare-Y,
I am the owner of that, and there i work with some friends that i give them the oportunitty to participate over proyects, under my supervision, I try to teach them, so i can trust them to get bigger proyects, and maybe, making stare-y something big in the future.

Anyway, to prove that i can work with the technologies mentioned above, here is a repo where i can show it (it is a MAUI app with all the good practices that i know):
https://github.com/Stare-Y/Optica

also, this other one to prove that i can work with API's (minimmal and controller based)
https://github.com/PoinTastY/ContpaqSDK-API

to prove my python skills, here is the repo where i have some proyects that i made for my school:
https://github.com/PoinTastY/Ingenieria-de-Software-programs

and also, my viola project, works with rasa opensource, and has actions with python:
https://github.com/PoinTastY/VIOLA

at the begining, there is my wakatime profile, but i just started using it, so the badge began from jun 2024
